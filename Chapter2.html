                <p>A paragraph consists of one or more sentences
                that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The
                start of a paragraph is indicated by a new
                line.</p>
                <p>Text is easier to understand when it is split up
                into units of text. For example, a book may have
                chapters. Chapters can have subheadings. Under
                each heading there will be one or more
                paragraphs.</p>
